- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @multigsw
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in re-vamping this site to show of my testing chops.  Everything I tested before wasn't mine (it became the IP of the company for which I worked)
So, I am going to be growing this space
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python, but I am strong in the ways of Ruby
- ðŸ“« How to reach me:  linkedin, look for Gregory Schmidt
